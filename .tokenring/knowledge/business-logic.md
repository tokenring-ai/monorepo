- Error propagation and recovery
- Response truncation for large outputs

**Business Rules:**
- Human requests can be forwarded or blocked based on context
- System errors are always included in responses for debugging
- Timeout handling prevents hanging agents
- Automatic cleanup prevents resource leaks

**Chat Command Interface:**
```bash
/work <message>               # Execute work with agent
/reset                       # Reset agent state
/settings <key> <value>       # Configure agent
/hook <name> <action>        # Manage lifecycle hooks
/debug <command>             # Debug operations
/help                        # Show help
/logs                        # View execution logs
```

### State Management Architecture

#### State Persistence Patterns

**TaskState Implementation:**
```typescript
class TaskState implements AgentStateSlice {
  tasks: Task[];
  autoApprove: number;
  parallelTasks: number;
  persistToSubAgents = true;

  // Checkpoint-based persistence
  serialize(): object
  deserialize(data: any): void
  reset(what: ResetWhat[]): void
}
```

**ScriptingContext Implementation:**
```typescript
class ScriptingContext implements AgentStateSlice {
  variables = new Map<string, string>();
  lists = new Map<string, string[]>();
  functions = new Map<string, FunctionDefinition>();

  // Variable interpolation and context management
  interpolate(text: string): string
}
```

**IterableState Implementation:**
```typescript
class IterableState implements AgentStateSlice {
  iterables: Map<string, StoredIterable>;

  // Persistent iterable definitions across sessions
}
```

**WorkQueueState Implementation:**
```typescript
class WorkQueueState implements AgentStateSlice {
  queue: QueueItem[];
  started: boolean;
  initialCheckpoint: AgentCheckpointData;
  currentItem: QueueItem;

  // Queue state preservation across processing
}
```

#### Agent State Architecture

**Core Agent State Management:**
```typescript
class Agent implements AskHumanInterface, ChatOutputStream, ServiceRegistryInterface {
  stateManager = new StateManager<AgentStateSlice>();
  
  // State operations
  initializeState = this.stateManager.initializeState.bind(this.stateManager);
  mutateState = this.stateManager.mutateState.bind(this.stateManager);
  getState = this.stateManager.getState.bind(this.stateManager);
  subscribeState = this.stateManager.subscribe.bind(this.stateManager);
  waitForState = this.stateManager.waitForState.bind(this.stateManager);
  
  // Checkpoint operations
  generateCheckpoint(): AgentCheckpointData
  restoreCheckpoint({state}: AgentCheckpointData): void
}
```

**Event Processing Architecture:**
```typescript
class AgentEventState implements SerializableStateSlice {
  events: AgentEventEnvelope[];
  busyWith: string | null;
  idle: boolean;
  waitingOn: HumanRequestEnvelope | null;

  // Event emission and cursor-based consumption
  emit(event: AgentEventEnvelope): void
  getEventCursorFromCurrentPosition(): AgentEventCursor
  *yieldEventsByCursor(cursor: AgentEventCursor): Generator<AgentEventEnvelope>
}
```

2. **Parallel Processing**: Multiple tasks processed simultaneously with controlled concurrency
3. **Approval Workflows**: Human-in-the-loop validation points
4. **Recovery Mechanisms**: Checkpoint-based recovery for failed workflows

### Business Rule Engine Characteristics

1. **Declarative Configuration**: Business rules defined via configuration files
2. **Runtime Validation**: Rule validation at execution time
3. **Context Injection**: Rules can access agent context and state
4. **Extensible Rule Types**: Support for custom rule implementations

### Integration Patterns

1. **Service Registry**: Dynamic service discovery and injection
2. **Event Bus**: EventEmitter-based communication
3. **State Management**: Centralized state with checkpoint persistence
4. **Hook System**: Lifecycle event processing

### Advanced Workflow Examples

#### Multi-Agent Development Workflow
```typescript
// 1. Create team of specialized agents
const team = new AgentTeam();
await team.addAgent('fullstack-developer', { /* config */ });
await team.addAgent('test-engineer', { /* config */ });
await team.addAgent('devops-engineer', { /* config */ });

// 2. Execute complex workflow
const taskId = taskService.addTask({
  name: "Implement new feature",
  agentType: "fullstack-developer",
  message: "Build the new user authentication system"
}, team.leader);

// 3. Automatic testing and deployment
await taskService.executeTasks([taskId], team.leader);
```

#### Script-Based Automation
```javascript
// Define reusable automation script
script myDeployment = [
  "/test run",
  "/git commit -m 'Automated deployment'",
  "/deploy production",
  "/notify team 'Deployment complete'"
];

// Execute with parameters
/script run myDeployment "v1.2.3"
```

#### Batch Processing Workflow
```typescript
// Define iterable for batch processing
await iterableService.define(
  "user-list",
  "database-query",
  { query: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE active = true" },
  "Active users for processing"
);

// Process in batches
/for user in user-list
  /call sendWelcomeEmail(user.email)
```

### Comprehensive Package Analysis

#### @tokenring-ai/tasks Deep Dive

**Task Planning Workflow:**
1. **Planning Phase**: Create comprehensive task plans with detailed context
2. **Approval Phase**: Task plan presented to user with clear descriptions and agent assignments
3. **Execution Phase**: Upon approval, tasks are added and executed immediately
4. **Tracking Phase**: Task status updated in real-time as agents complete work
5. **Results Phase**: Execution results collected and reported back

**Task Interface Design:**
```typescript
interface Task {
  id: string;                    // Unique identifier
  name: string;                  // Descriptive task name
  agentType: string;             // Type of agent to handle the task
  message: string;               // Main task description (1 paragraph)
  context: string;               // Detailed execution instructions (3+ paragraphs)
  status: 'pending' | 'running' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  result?: string;               // Execution result if completed
}
```

**Parallel Execution Engine:**
```typescript
async executeTasks(taskIds: string[], parentAgent: Agent): Promise<string[]> {
  const parallelTasks = state.parallelTasks || 1;
  // Execute tasks with controlled parallelism using async.mapLimit
  return await async.mapLimit(taskIds, parallelTasks, executeTask);
}
```

const task2 = taskService.addTask({...}, agent);
await taskService.executeTasks([task1, task2], agent);
```

**Parallel Workflows:**
```typescript
// Multiple agents working simultaneously
const results = await Promise.all([
  runSubAgent({agentType: "agent1", message: "task1"}, agent),
  runSubAgent({agentType: "agent2", message: "task2"}, agent)
]);
```

**Hybrid Workflows:**
```typescript
// Sequential planning with parallel execution
const plan = await createPlan(agent);
const tasks = await decomposePlan(plan);
await taskService.executeTasks(tasks, agent);
```

#### Context Management Patterns

**State Accumulation:**
```typescript
// Memory-based context building
memoryService.addMemory("Context item 1", agent);
memoryService.addMemory("Context item 2", agent);
// Context automatically available to agents
```

**Context Injection:**
```typescript
// Scripts automatically receive context
/var $context = memory.get("project_context")
/func llm analyze($input) => "Analyze $input with context: $context"
```

#### Error Recovery Patterns

**Checkpoint Recovery:**
```typescript
// Restore to previous state on failure
try {
  await riskyOperation(agent);
} catch (error) {
  agent.restoreCheckpoint(checkpoint);
}
```

**Circuit Breaker:**
```typescript
// Prevent cascade failures
if (failureCount > threshold) {
  circuitBreaker.open = true;
  // Block requests until timeout
}
```
