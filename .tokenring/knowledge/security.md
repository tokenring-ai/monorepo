# Security Knowledge Repository

This file maintains knowledge about security vulnerabilities, controls, and best practices in the TokenRing project.

## Discovered Security Information

### Initial Analysis Scope
- Focus: TokenRing AI security architecture and defense patterns
- Key packages: @tokenring-ai/vault, @tokenring-ai/agent, @tokenring-ai/sandbox, @tokenring-ai/aws
- Priority: Access control, credential management, security token handling
- Approach: Pattern-based security analysis rather than exhaustive coverage

### Security Review Agent Configuration
- **Agent Type**: Background agent specialized in security assessments
- **Purpose**: Vulnerability identification, security control implementation, compliance assessment
- **Expertise**: OWASP Top 10, threat modeling, secure coding practices
- **Knowledge Management**: Maintains security repository for future reference

### Core Security Patterns Discovered

#### 1. Vault Package (`pkg/vault/vault.ts`)
**Encryption Implementation:**
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM with PBKDF2 key derivation
- **Key Derivation**: 100,000 iterations using SHA-256
- **Salt**: 16-byte random salt per encryption
- **IV**: 12-byte initialization vector
- **Authentication**: GCM provides both confidentiality and integrity

**Security Strengths:**
- Strong encryption with proper key derivation
- Random salt prevents rainbow table attacks
- Authentication tag prevents tampering
- Proper error handling for missing vault files
- File permissions set to 0o600 (owner read/write only)
- PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations (OWASP recommended minimum)
- AAD (Additional Authenticated Data) for integrity
- Secure file deletion with random data overwriting

**Potential Concerns:**
- Password-based encryption (weak passwords vulnerable to brute force)
- No rate limiting on failed decryption attempts
- No key rotation mechanism visible
- Credentials stored in constructor properties (potential memory exposure)

#### 2. Agent Package Security Architecture
**Multi-Agent Isolation:**
- Agents run in isolated contexts with separate state management
- Sub-agent creation with configurable output forwarding
- State persistence via checkpoints (potential data exposure risk)
- Event-driven architecture with proper separation of concerns

**Access Control Patterns:**
- Service registry with typed access control (`requireServiceByType`)
- Human interface requests with proper type safety
- State management with serialization/deserialization controls
- Agent lifecycle management with cleanup procedures

**Potential Security Risks:**
- State serialization could expose sensitive data if not properly sanitized
- Sub-agent communication lacks input validation boundaries
- Human interface requests could be vectors for injection attacks
- No apparent authentication/authorization for agent operations
- UUID-based agent identification (predictable patterns)

#### 3. Sandbox Package Security Features
**Container Security:**
- Abstract provider interface for extensibility
- Container isolation through Docker provider
- Command execution in controlled environments
- Container lifecycle management (create/stop/remove)
- Log isolation and management

**Security Controls:**
- Label-based container identification
- Provider switching for flexibility
- Timeout controls for command execution
- Error handling for missing containers
- Service integration with proper type safety

**Security Considerations:**
- Container escape potential if Docker provider compromised
- No resource limits or quota enforcement visible
- Command injection possibilities in executeCommand tool
- No network isolation controls
- Privilege escalation potential through container configurations
- Insufficient input sanitization in command execution

#### 4. AWS Package Security Implementation
**Credential Management:**
- **STS Integration**: Uses Security Token Service for authentication
- **SDK v3 Clients**: Modern AWS SDK with proper credential handling
- **Credential Validation**: Checks for required credentials before operations
- **Session Token Support**: Handles temporary credentials appropriately

**Security Strengths:**
- Proper credential validation with `isAuthenticated()` checks
- Client initialization with typed credentials interface
- Error handling for authentication failures
- Region specification for proper AWS service configuration
- Separation of concerns between STS and S3 clients
- Fake credential detection
- Credential validation before operations

**Potential Risks:**
- Credentials stored in constructor properties (potential memory exposure)
- No credential rotation mechanisms
- No temporary credential refresh logic
- S3 bucket listing could expose sensitive bucket names

#### 5. Filesystem Package Security Implementation
**File System Security:**
- Abstract provider pattern for different filesystem implementations
- Dangerous command pattern filtering
- Ignore filters for secure file traversal
- Path normalization and validation

**Security Controls:**
- **Dangerous Command Filtering**: `/rm\b/, /mv\b/` patterns blocked
- **Ignore Filters**: `.git`, `node_modules`, `.gitignore`, `.aiignore`
- **Path Validation**: Relative/absolute path conversion
- **File Permissions**: chmod operations supported

**Security Features:**
- Shell command execution with pattern filtering
- File selection and context management
- Secure directory tree traversal
- Git integration for version control

**Potential Risks:**
- Command filtering may be bypassable with complex commands
- Path traversal vulnerabilities if not properly validated
- File permission changes could create security holes
- Shell injection through insufficient escaping
- Environment variable exposure

### Enhanced Security Implementations

- Path validation preventing directory traversal
- Environment variable name validation
- Blocking of dangerous variables (PATH, LD_PRELOAD, etc.)
- Container security label validation
- Isolation verification

#### 7. Enhanced Shell Command Security (`pkg/filesystem/tools/runShellCommand.ts`)
**Comprehensive Security Features:**
- Multi-pattern dangerous command filtering
- Working directory validation and sanitization
